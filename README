A fork of the 2013 SDK, with additions/modifications from my YouTube videos linked below. This (currently) covers all Singleplayer changes from tutorials 0.5 to 31 (excluding 6/7/8/15/24 i.e. shader stuff) and Source Shorts 1 to 18 (excluding 2/7/8/10/15/17 i.e. Multiplayer stuff, using leaked engine code and Fake CSM from celisej567). Multiplayer changes will come eventually. Let me know if there are any issues!
